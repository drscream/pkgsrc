SecureSkat is a peer-to-peer implementation of the card game Skat.

The program negotiates possible players and sessions over an arbitrary
IRC network (Internet Relay Chat). It uses the C++ library LibTMCG to
ensure a reasonable level of verifiablility for card operations.
Furthermore, SecureSkat provides electronic voting capabilities based
on a simple playing card encoding.
