LibTMCG is a free C++ library for creating secure and verifiable online
card games. The library contains a sort of useful classes, algorithms,
and high-level protocols to support an application programmer in writing
such software. The most remarkable feature is the absence of a trusted
third party (TTP), i.e., neither a central game server nor trusted
hardware components are necessary.
